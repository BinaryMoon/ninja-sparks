Take a behind-the-scenes look at the fascinating world of set design on the Apple TV show *Silo* with Adam Savage.

*Note: These videos contain some spoilers for Season 2 of Silo. If you’re planning to watch it, you might want to save them for later.*

I really miss the detailed behind-the-scenes features we used to get on DVDs. While Disney+ still offers some, they often feel more like promotional material than true insights into the creative process.

This is where YouTube really shines. As a Brit, I’ve always been aware of Adam Savage and *MythBusters*, though I never had the opportunity to watch it. But since he transitioned to YouTube, I’ve come across so many fun, movie-related videos.

Adam has made multiple videos about *Silo*, including ones on stunts, VFX, and more. If you’re a fan of filmmaking, they’re well worth exploring!
