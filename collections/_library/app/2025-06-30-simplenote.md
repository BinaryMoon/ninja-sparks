Notes are synced in real time through the cloud and can be accessed via mobile apps (iOS, Android), desktop apps (Windows, macOS, Linux), or a web interface.

Key features include tagging, note version history, markdown support, and full-text search. Simplenote does not support rich text or file attachments, focusing instead on speed, simplicity, and reliability.
