Affinity Studio is the new all-in-one creative app from Serif, combining bitmap editing, vector design and desktop publishing in a single tool. It replaces the previous Affinity Photo, Designer and Publisher apps, which were paid individually. The new app is free to use, with optional paid Canva features.

The release follows Canva’s acquisition of Serif, and while the long-term direction is still taking shape, Affinity Studio already works well for general creative work. Switching between editing modes is quick, and the workflow feels smooth and consistent.

Affinity Studio is currently available for Windows and Mac, with an iPad version in development. It remains a strong alternative to Adobe’s creative apps and is worth exploring if you want a capable, lightweight and cost-free creative suite.
