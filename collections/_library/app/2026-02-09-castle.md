Castle is a mobile app for iOS and Android that lets you create and share small interactive “toys”. It sits between a drawing tool, a game maker, and a storytelling app, with a focus on play, experimentation, and personal expression.

Creations are built from simple visual blocks and cards that define how things behave. Instead of timelines or complex scripting, Castle encourages interaction first. Projects can range from quiet, slideshow-style stories to playful physics-based games. You can draw your own assets, remix built-in elements, or start from ready-made templates.

What sets Castle apart is its handmade feel. The app encourages rough edges, curiosity, and creative exploration rather than polish or technical perfection. It lowers the barrier to making interactive work, making it approachable for beginners while still leaving room to experiment and grow.

Castle feels like a modern echo of early creative tools on the web: simple, playful, and community-driven, where making things is as important as sharing them.
