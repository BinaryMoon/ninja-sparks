This interactive Google Doodle celebrates Gerald “Jerry” Lawson, a key figure in early video game technology. It includes a built-in game maker that lets you create and play your own simple games — either platformers or top-down adventures.

The tool starts with a short interactive tutorial that introduces the basics of building a game. After that, you can design your own levels using a visual editor. Add characters, enemies, platforms, doors, keys, and more. It’s very easy to use, with a drag-and-drop interface that works well for beginners.

Games are saved to your Google account, making them easy to come back to or share with others. It’s similar to apps like [Pocket Platformer]({% link _library/app/2025-01-27-pocket-platformer.md %}), but with Google integration and a polished interface. Best experienced in Chrome.

*Note that to play the doodle you visit the website, and then click on the doodle at the top of the page and it will open up. I found it didn't work in Firefox (which may be down to extensions I have installed) but it works fine in Chrome.*
