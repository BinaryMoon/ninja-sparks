It uses *Lua*, a beginner-friendly programming language popular in hobbyist game dev, and has a thriving community creating and sharing projects.

Pico-8 was created by *Lexaloffle* who also developed [Voxatron](https://www.lexaloffle.com/voxatron.php) (a 3D voxel game maker) and [Picotron](https://www.lexaloffle.com/picotron.php) (a fantasy operating system).
