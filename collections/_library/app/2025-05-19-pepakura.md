Pepakura Designer is a clever app that turns 3D models into printable paper craft templates. Just import a 3D file, and it unfolds the shape into flat pieces you can print, cut, and glue to build real-world modelsâ€”perfect for cosplay, props, or just fun papercraft. Great for anyone who likes mixing digital design with hands-on creativity.
