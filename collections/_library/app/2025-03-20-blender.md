[Blender][blender-link] is a powerful, free, and open-source 3D creation suite used by artists, animators, and studios around the world. It covers the full pipeline—modeling, animation, rendering, simulation, video editing, and more—and is backed by an active open-source community and the non-profit Blender Foundation.

Recently, Blender hit the spotlight with *Flow*, an animated feature made entirely in Blender by a small team. The film won an Oscar and shows what’s possible with the software—even on a tight budget. You can watch the [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zebbk0tm7n0), check out the [behind-the-scenes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw-a7buP4KA), or read the [interview with director Gints Zilbalodis](https://www.blender.org/user-stories/making-flow-an-interview-with-director-gints-zilbalodis/).
