Nomad Sculpt is a professional-grade 3D sculpting app designed for mobile devices, especially iPad. It offers real-time sculpting with tools like dynamesh-style remeshing, masking, symmetry, layers, alphas, and vertex painting. The app also includes basic rendering features for showcasing finished models without needing to export.

It supports Apple Pencil for pressure-sensitive sculpting and works smoothly even on older devices. Nomad Sculpt is often seen as a mobile alternative to ZBrush, offering many of the same core features in a streamlined, touch-friendly interface.
