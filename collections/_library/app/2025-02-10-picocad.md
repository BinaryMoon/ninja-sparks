**PicoCAD** is a delightfully simple 3D modeling tool designed for low-poly creations with a charming retro aesthetic. Built around creative constraints, it embraces the minimalism of early 3D graphics, making it perfect for models that feel right at home on a PlayStation, GameCube, or classic PC game.

Despite its simplicity, PicoCAD packs in a surprising amount of functionality. You can create, texture, and manipulate 3D shapes using an interface that feels like an old-school game editor. It's an ideal tool for pixel artists, indie game developers, and anyone curious about exploring 3D art in a lightweight, intuitive way.

PicoCAD is now available on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2800590/picoCAD/), making it even easier to dive into low-poly modeling.
