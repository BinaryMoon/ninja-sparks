[Wareware](https://wareware.rip/) is a playful 3D game-making platform that runs entirely in the browser. It lets you build small, blocky worlds by dropping ramps, walls, and characters into a scene. Everything has a charming, pastel look with wobbly text and bouncy 2D sprites that always face the camera. It feels more like a 3D version of Bitsy than a full engine, focusing on creativity and fun over complexity.

The editor is refreshingly simple. You can give characters actions like talking, changing rooms, playing sounds, or restarting the game. At the moment it is quite limited, with no enemies and only basic logic, but that simplicity is what makes it approachable. You can hit play immediately and explore a ready-made room, then quickly build from there.

Finished projects can be exported as standalone HTML files that run in any modern browser, making them easy to share. Wareware is free to try during early access, with a small but growing community around it. It is a lovely example of how game creation can be playful and accessible to everyone.
