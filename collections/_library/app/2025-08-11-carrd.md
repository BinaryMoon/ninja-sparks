[Carrd](https://carrd.co) is a simple website builder for single-page sites. It’s quick to use, requires no coding, and works well for portfolios, landing pages, link hubs, or class information pages. You can add text, images, videos, buttons, and forms, then publish to a free subdomain or connect your own custom domain with a low-cost Pro plan. The editor is straightforward but flexible, making it ideal for creatives, small businesses, and teachers who want a professional-looking site without the hassle.

The clear [Carrd documentation](https://carrd.co/docs) covers everything from getting started to advanced features like embeds and custom code. It’s easy to follow, even for beginners, so you can have something live in an afternoon that looks great on any device.
