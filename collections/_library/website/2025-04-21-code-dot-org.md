**Code.org** is a free online platform that teaches coding through interactive, browser-based lessons. Itâ€™s designed for students of all ages, with a particular focus on beginners and younger learners.

The site uses a block-based visual programming system similar to Scratch, making it accessible for those with no prior experience. For learners ready to explore text-based code, many tutorials offer the option to view and write JavaScript alongside the blocks.

Lessons are grouped into structured courses by grade level, covering foundational concepts like sequencing, loops, events, and conditionals. As users progress, they unlock more creative tools and open-ended projects. These include the Game Lab, App Lab, and Music Lab, where students can design their own games, apps, animations, or music projects using real code.

Code.org features themed tutorials using popular characters from Minecraft, Angry Birds, Frozen, and more. These activities are often introduced by familiar faces like YouTubers or educators to help make the lessons more engaging.

All tools and courses run in the browser, with no software to install. Progress is saved using a free account, and the site is widely used in schools around the world. Some newer tools also include AI-powered features, offering learners a chance to explore emerging technology in a safe and creative environment.
