**Fold Up Toys** is a creative website dedicated to downloadable paper toys designed by Alex Gwynne. Each toy is typically laid out on a single printable sheet and crafted to be cut out, folded, and glued together. The designs cover a wide range of themes, from pop culture to original creations, and are known for their charm, clever engineering, and accessible format.

Alex creates these toys by hand, sketching and calculating each fold without the aid of 3D software - an approach that gives the toys a unique, handcrafted feel. The site offers a mix of free downloads and exclusive content available through Patreon, where supporters can receive a new toy design each month. Fold Up Toys also takes on commissions for custom designs, often working with brands and organisations to produce themed models.
