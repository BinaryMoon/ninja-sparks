Welcome to a brand new issue of Ninja Sparks. I've now been writing this newsletter for over a year and it's been a great way to share the things I have found. I hope you're enjoying it, do let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions for things to include in future issues!

The weather has been terrible in the UK recently, with lots of rain and flooding in the areas I live. But that hasn't stopped me from doing things, in fact it forces us to be more creative with our time. I'm currently working on some updates to Brush Ninja. Nothing groundbreaking, but some nice smaller improvements that I hope will make the overall experience nicer.

My son will be having his birthday soon, the big 1 0. I can't believe how quickly he's grown up, but it's been a joy to watch him develop. He's recently been talking about what he wants to do when he grows up, specifically he wants to do what I do. I think he's mostly interested in working from home and spending all his time on the computer so I don't know how this will work out, but it's nice to know he's interested in similar things to me. I hope we can work out a way to make something work, but I also hope he gets a real job for a short time at least since i think the experience of that sort of thing is really valuable. We shall see.

## Castle

Castle is a mobile app for IOS and Android that allows you to create and share interactive toys. It's a bit like the Brush Ninja animation editor in that it allows you to create things with a simple interface. But instead of making animations you make interactive toys. They can be as simple as slideshow style stories, through to physics based games. The app is designed to be easy to use, so you can create something fun in just a few minutes. You can also share your creations with the community and play with what others have made.

Everything made with it is very hand made and has lots of personality. Which has always been a goal with Brush Ninja as well, and it's nice to see another tool that encourages that sort of creativity. It's also a great example of how you can make something simple and fun without needing to be a professional game developer or animator. The app is free to download and use, with some optional in-app purchases for additional features.

Castle includes many many templates and examples to get you started quickly. It also has a simple scripting language that allows you to add interactivity. Everything is built as a group of 'cards' that you can arrange and connect. You can draw assets, or use built in interactive elements. You can very quickly make something that feels like a game or interactive story.

It's the sort of technical tool that encourages creativity and experimentation through play. If I wasn't already a programmer I could see myself spending a lot of time playing with it. It reminds a bit of the early days of Flash with lots of people making fun things quickly.

There are a variety of [tools and tutorials on the official PicoCAD website][picocad-link].

## The sad story of Flash

Flash was a multimedia software platform that was widely used for creating animations, games, and interactive content on the web. It was originally developed by FutureWave software as FutureSplash and then bought by Macromedia and rebranded as Flash. Macromedia was later bought by Adobe. Flash allowed developers to create rich, interactive experiences that could be easily embedded in web pages.

It's because of Flash that I got my start in the industry, working for Miniclip a company founded on Flash games. I started as an animator and then moved into web design later becoming the Director of Web Development. In my time at Miniclip I worked on many Flash games and animations, it was a great time and there was so much innovation happening. Flash was a great tool for beginners and professionals alike, with a low barrier to entry and a lot of creative freedom.

However, Flash had its problems. It was often criticised for being slow, buggy, and a security risk. It also had issues with mobile devices, particularly after Apple famously refused to support it on the iPhone. As a result, many developers started to move away from Flash in favour of newer technologies like HTML5, which offered better performance and security. Eventually, Adobe announced that it would stop supporting Flash at the end of 2020.

With the end of Flash, Adobe had a still popular app on its hands that was no longer usable for it's original purpose. But they rebranded it to Adobe Animate, which is a powerful animation tool that is used by a lot of professionals in the industry. There's [a list of cartoons made with Animate of wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Flash_animated_television_series) - it's long.

Last week Adobe announced they would be ending support for Animate in 2026, and users would be unable to access their files or the software. This caused a huge outcry from the creative community, with many businesses and individuals relying on Animate for their work. Adobe's decision was met with criticism for not providing a clear migration path for users, and for effectively rendering years of creative work inaccessible.

Fortunately Adobe have now reversed their decision and said they will continue to support Animate technically but will no longer be developing it. This is a relief, but also a sign (as if another one was needed) that they can't be trusted.

I have long advocated for moving away from Adobe products, they are expensive and have toxic cancellation clauses. They are increasingly adding AI features that reduce the quality of the art and the need for skilled artists. I even went so far as to make a website full of alternatives to Adobe products called [SwapCreate](https://swapcreate.com).

## The Hyrule Fantasy

{% include embed-youtube.html video="y0G3_iu4fGQ" %}

The Hyrule Fantasy is a short file by Ousmane Cissé, a talented animator from France. It is a tribute to one of my favorite franchises, the Legend of Zelda. It has a charming distinctive style that is very different to the games, but it captures the spirit of joy and discovery that I associate with the series.

If you like this then they also have a shorter [One Piece tribute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMh-21wUaJA) that is worth cheching out.

## Currently Watching

I am currently on the last couple of episodes of After Party, a cosy murder show on Apple TV+. I've really enjoyed how the characters are unreliable witnesses and all have their own motivations and perspectives which get shown as they tell their stories in each episode. Each episode focuses on a different character telling the story of what led up to the murder from their own viewpoint, with their own biases and framing leading you in different directions. In the first season one of the episodes is largely a cartoon. You also see things in earlier episodes that are only explained/ made clear later. It's a fun nice take on the Agatha Christie style whodunnit genre which is currently getting a revival with movies like the Knives Out series, and books like Thursday Murder Club.

With my son we have been watching Ronja and the Robbers daughter. It's a nice story with beautiful animation, but it did feel very slow and the voice acting feels stilted and over the top. The english voice actors are all established names so I'm surprised they messed that up so much.
