Welcome to a new issue of Ninja Sparks. I've now been writing this newsletter for over a year and it's been a fun way to share the things I have found. I hope you're enjoying it, please let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions for things to include in future issues!

Over the last couple of weeks I have been doing some work on [Brush Ninja](https://brush.ninja), tidying up the user interactions to make it nicer to use. All small changes that will hopefully go unnoticed, but also make the experience smoother.

My son, on the other hand, has recently started getting into Lego. He's 9 now, and we introduced it years ago, but it never really stuck until now. A couple of weekends ago he adopted a "pet" pebble and decided it needed a house. What began as a single room has slowly grown into multiple rooms, a garden, and even a balcony.

I've always been sure he's a creative person, but he's never been particularly interested in showing it. That's what's been so nice to see. We actively limit his screen time, even though he'd happily have more. It's a deliberate choice, partly because it's hard enough for adults to manage screens without adding that weight to children who are still figuring the world out.

Lately though, he's been off building new additions to the pebble's house, completely absorbed. Watching that kind of unprompted, playful creativity emerge has been genuinely lovely. It's also a good reminder that the right tools, and a bit of space, can go a long way.

## Castle

[Castle][castle-link] is a mobile app for iOS and Android that gives you simple tools and plenty of space to experiment. It lets you create and share interactive "toys", sitting somewhere between a drawing app, a game maker, and a storytelling tool. The interface is intentionally straightforward, so you can make something playful in minutes rather than hours.

Rather than focusing on timelines or keyframes, Castle is built around interaction. Creations range from slideshow-style stories to small physics-based games. Everything is assembled from visual blocks and cards that you connect together to define behaviour. You can draw your own assets, remix built-in elements, or start from one of many templates.

What stands out most is how handmade everything feels. Creations are rough around the edges in a good way, full of personality and small surprises. That aligns closely with what I aim for with Brush Ninja, and it's refreshing to see another tool leaning into creativity over polish.

Castle also feels like a modern echo of early Flash. People making strange, playful things quickly, sharing them, and building on each other's ideas. You do not need to think of yourself as a game developer to enjoy it. Curiosity is enough.

The app is free to use, with optional purchases for extra features, and the community side is very much part of the appeal.

## The Sad Story of Flash

Flash was a multimedia platform used for animations, games, and interactive content across the web. It began as FutureSplash, was later acquired by Macromedia, and eventually became part of Adobe. For a long time, Flash was the easiest way to make expressive, interactive work online.

It was also where I started professionally, first as an animator and later moving into web design and development. Flash lowered the barrier to entry in a way few tools have managed since, and it enabled a huge amount of creative experimentation.

Over time, its problems became harder to ignore. Performance issues, security concerns, and poor support on mobile devices pushed the industry towards open web standards like HTML5. Adobe officially ended Flash support in 2020.

Adobe Animate, the rebranded successor, survived as a professional animation tool. Many cartoon studios still rely on it. Recently, [Adobe announced plans to end active development and limit long-term access](https://www.cartoonbrew.com/tools/adobe-animate-software-sunset-258612.html), which caused understandable concern. That decision has since been [partially reversed](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/adobe-reverses-decision-to-discontinue-animate-after-a-lot-of-confusion-and-angst/), with Animate continuing in maintenance mode.

The episode is a reminder of the risks of closed creative tools. When access disappears, years of work can vanish with it. This is one of the reasons I continue to favour simpler, more open alternatives where possible, and why I built [SwapCreate](https://swapcreate.com) as a catalogue of options outside the Adobe ecosystem.

## The Hyrule Fantasy

{% include embed-youtube.html video="y0G3_iu4fGQ" %}

The Hyrule Fantasy is a short film by Ousmane Cissé, an animator from France. It is a tribute to The Legend of Zelda, reimagined in a loose, expressive style that feels personal rather than referential.

It does not try to replicate the games. Instead, it captures the feeling of exploration and quiet wonder that sits underneath them. The result feels thoughtful and sincere, and well worth a few minutes.

If you enjoy this, there is also a shorter [One Piece tribute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMh-21wUaJA) on the same channel that is worth a look.

## Hacktivate

{% include embed-image.html image="/images/updates/2026/hacktivate-menu.png" caption="The Hacktivate game menu" %}

Last issue I mentioned the game [Hacktivate](https://www.hacktivate.app). I'm still playing through it and I really enjoy it. The reason I mention it again is because there has been a big update to the game that adds solutions to all of the puzzles, so you can learn how they should have been completed. This was my biggest complaint previously. If you got really stuck on a puzzle, or you brute forced one, there was no way to learn the intended solution. But now there is and it makes things so much better. I now want to go through the game again and see what I did wrong and how I could have done things better.

## [Fun Playground Equipment](https://fujio-pand-park.tumblr.com/)

{% include embed-image.html image="/images/updates/2026/playground-fun.png" caption="An artistic piece of playground equipment from Japan" %}

This is a fascinating selection of photos from Japan by photographer Fujio Kito showing a wide array of playground equipment. In the UK playgrounds tend to be fairly standardised. Lots of wooden frames, metal poles, and slides. These Japanese playgrounds are incredibly imaginitive, with play equipment designed to look like all sorts of things - often animals. Some are based on real animals, and others are fantastical creations. They add a lot of personality and fun to the playgrounds. Of course it's not just animals, there's robots, buildings, and abstract shapes too. It's a great reminder that playgrounds can be more than just functional spaces - they can be places that spark imagination and joy - ideal for their intended audience!

## Currently Watching

I am currently on the last couple of episodes of After Party, a cosy murder show on Apple TV+. I've really enjoyed how the characters are unreliable witnesses and all have their own motivations and perspectives which get shown as they tell their stories in each episode. Each episode focuses on a different character telling the story of what led up to the murder from their own viewpoint, with their own biases and framing leading you in different directions. In the first season one of the episodes is largely a cartoon. You also see things in earlier episodes that are only explained/ made clear later. It's a fun nice take on the Agatha Christie style whodunnit genre which is currently getting a revival with movies like the Knives Out series, and books like Thursday Murder Club.

With my son we have been watching Ronja and the Robbers daughter. It's a nice story with beautiful animation, but it did feel very slow and the voice acting feels stilted and over the top. The english voice actors are all established names so I'm surprised they messed did so poorly there.
