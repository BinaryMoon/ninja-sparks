Hey there,

I hope you're doing well! I've been poorly the last few days, just a cold but it's annoying with all the sniffling and coughing. I went away with the family over the Easter break, and also had my birthday so I'm feeling old and tired, but I have so many things I want to do.

Work wise I've been trying to get beep8 to a stage where I can start properly promoting it (although it's all live [beep8.com](https://beep8.com) and [beepmini.com](https://beepmini.com)). I've also been thinking about doing some work on [Brush.Ninja](https://brush.ninja) and [NinjaPuzzles.com](https://ninjapuzzles.com) since I have been focused on beep8 for a while and they need some attention.

It's fun working for yourself, but it's also hard when you juggle lots of different things. But I don't like the idea of relying on a single project so I have a few things going at once. It keeps things interesting and provides a bit of security.

## Learning to Code with Code.org

{% include embed-image.html image="/images/updates/code-dot-org.png" caption="Code.org homepage" %}

My 9-year-old is really into computers, so I've been on the hunt for fun ways to teach him useful skills. One site we've both come to love is [code.org][codeord-link]. It's packed with beginner-friendly lessons that teach coding through games like Minecraft, Angry Birds, and even Frozen.

What really won him over was seeing YouTuber Amy Lee introducing some of the lessons. He already watches her videos, so having her pop up in a coding course felt like a nice crossover episode. She introduces the Minecraft lessons, which at first seemed quite straightforward, but turned out to be fun programming puzzles that got him thinking about how to solve problems in a different way.

The tutorials use a block-based system based on Scratch, which is perfect for younger kids. But what I really like is that you can toggle over to see the actual JavaScript behind the blocks. That gives curious kids an early look at how real code works, which is brilliant for building confidence and making the jump to text-based languages later.

Code.org is cleverly structured into courses by grade level, so it grows with your child. The early lessons are simple enough to do solo, but things get more open-ended as they go. There's more room for creativity, including building your own games or interactive stories. This is what my son likes the most. He enjoys doing his own thing, so being able to customise the projects keeps him engaged.

It also includes a visual game lab, an app lab and a music lab, so older learners can start designing their own apps or animations using real code. Everything runs in the browser, no installs needed, and progress is saved with a free account. Some of the apps (such as the music one shown above) even include AI features, which is a fun addition.

A quick note on AI. Iâ€™m both a fan and a critic. I worry about the legal and ethical issues, especially around image generation and copyright infringement. Iâ€™m also concerned about the environmental impact, since training and running AI takes a lot of power.

That said, I do see the potential for good. AI could help in education, healthcare, and even programming. I believe the energy costs will come down as hardware and software improve. But the risks to jobs are real, and using artists' work without consent is just wrong.

Anyway - my son has completed a good chunk of the courses and has recently started doing the same modules at school, which we didn't expect. Since he knows what he's doing, he finishes early and then helps the teacher and other students. He loves it, and I think itâ€™s boosting his confidence and social skills. Itâ€™s not something we set out to achieve, but itâ€™s been brilliant to see him helping others.

If you're looking for something that entertains and educates, and actually sets kids up for real-world coding, this is a solid place to start.

## Introducing the Nintendo Switch 2

{% include embed-youtube.html video="VrTVeYm4iIM" %}

Iâ€™ve been a Nintendo fan for as long as I can remember. I grew up with the NES, SNES, and N64, and Iâ€™ve kept buying their consoles ever since. Last week, the Switch 2 was officially announced.

Itâ€™s a true successor to the original Switch, with upgrades across the board. Itâ€™s more powerful, has a bigger and better screen, and improved controllers. Nintendo usually leads with wild new ideas, but this time itâ€™s all about refinement.

So far, thereâ€™s no killer app. The new Mario Kart looks great, with open-world elements, but itâ€™s not a game-changer. Thereâ€™s also a new Donkey Kong platformer that feels like a spiritual sequel to Super Mario Odyssey. Thatâ€™s exciting because Odyssey is one of my all-time favourites.

Most of the other titles shown were ports from other systems. That tells us something important. The Switch 2 has power. Nintendo has never cared much about specs, but if they want strong third-party support, theyâ€™ll need it. This could be a sign that more big-name AAA games are finally on the way.

## Sparked Discoveries

Hereâ€™s a handful of links I found intriguing recently:

### [Retro game anthology UFO 50 holds a treasure trove of thinky games](https://thinkygames.com/features/ufo-50-thinky-games/)

**UFO 50** is a collection of 50 retro-style games, each with its own unique twist. The project is led by Derek Yu (creator of *Spelunky*) and developed by a small team of indie devs. The games are designed for short play sessions, packed with clever mechanics and charming pixel art. Itâ€™s more than just a compilation. The games are tied together through a fictional gaming history, creating a shared universe across the collection. Reading about UFO 50 last year is what kicked off my work on [beep8](https://beepmini.com). Iâ€™d been toying with retro game ideas for a while, and UFO 50 showed how to make them feel connected.

### [Tobebuild](https://tobebuild.archi/)

**Tobebuild** is a visual gallery of architecture in progress. It showcases buildings and structures in various states of completion, with a strong focus on form and space. Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by architecture, especially brutalism. I love the shapes, shadows, and bold geometry. This site captures that evolving rawness in a way thatâ€™s oddly meditative.

### [CSS Clicker](https://lyra.horse/css-clicker/)

This one blew my mind. **CSS Clicker** is a fully playable clicker game made entirely with CSS - no JavaScript. You click to earn points, just like any idle game, but everything from logic to animation is done using CSS only. Iâ€™ve been working with CSS since the 90s and still donâ€™t fully understand how this works. Itâ€™s a brilliant example of creative coding and pushing boundaries in a very weird and clever way.
