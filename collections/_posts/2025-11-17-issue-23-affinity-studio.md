Last week I joined a game jam for fun and tried to make a small BeepMini game. I got the basic idea working fast, but making lots of levels by hand felt painful. That pushed me to think about a level editor.

At first I planned a quick and messy tool. Then I realised my adventure game editor already did most of the work. So I’m turning it into a general editor that uses config files and can handle different types of games.

The first step is adding worlds and levels. This means I can build separate areas for each game and bigger spaces for adventure games. After that, I’m adding paths, which I need for my stealth game so guards can patrol. This will also help NPCs move around in adventure games.

All of this should make it far easier to build platformers and other multi-level games that use a grid. I’ll likely release several versions so others can build their own games too.

## Affinity Studio

I don't like Adobe software. Their licensing is toxic and anti consumer. I even went so far as to make a website listing all of the Adobe software alternatives I could find ([SwapCreate](https://swapcreate.com/)).

One of the top alternatives to Adobe software is the Affinity suite by Serif. A year or so ago Affinity was purchased by Canva, which made me nervous, but a couple of weeks ago they announced what the merger meant.

Affinity used to be 3 paid apps - Affinity Photo (bitmap editor), Affinity Designer (vector editor) and Affinity Publisher (layout app). Each app cost around $50, which was a one time payment, so it was a great deal compared to Adobe's subscription model, but they have now been replaced by a single app called Affinity Studio.

Affinity Studio is now released, and it's free! There is the option to pay for additional Canva features, most of which are AI based, but these aren't needed and everything else works as is.

I should also mention that it's very new, so we don't know how it will evolve and if anything else will change or be removed, but for the time being I think it's promising and is still a great alternative to the main apps from the Adobe suite.

The new Affinity Studio app is a single app that combines a bitmap editor, a vector editor and a layout (desktop publishing) app all in one. You can switch between the different modes as needed and at any time, and it works really well.

I tried it earlier and created a vector shape, then switched to pixel mode and added some brush effects, then switched to layout mode and moved the elements around on the page. It's really clever how seamlessly the different modes work together.

Currently Affinity Studio is only available for desktop (Windows and Mac), but they have said there's an iPad version in the works, and that will be really good. It'll help my comic workflow massively since I will be able to do everything on the iPad without needing to switch apps.

I am not sure how this will evolve, but for now it's a great free alternative to Adobe software, and I recommend checking it out.

## The World of the Dark Crystal

{% include embed-youtube.html video="p-f54lkXhbQ" %}

This is an amazing behind the scenes look at the making of the Dark Crystal movie. When I saw the Dark Crystal back in the 80s it was a revelation. So different from anything else I'd seen before. It's a fully fantasy world with amazing puppetry by Jim Henson's team.

I love fantasy movies (and books and games) and this is a rare example of the type. These days fantasy is often mixed with science fiction, or just not given the full treatment it deserves. The Dark Crystal is pure fantasy.

I'd love to see more original movies like this, with full world building, and complex stories. There's too many reboots and remakes these days. It's boring and uninspired - and I want to see more creativity and originality.

In this video they go into detail about how they made the movie, the puppetry, the sets, the costumes, and the special effects. I'm amazed at the sheer scale of the production. I didn't realise the puppets were so big and complex. In hindsight it makes sense that many of the characters had actors inside them, but at the time they seemed like living creatures. The scale of the sets is incredible. They built full-sized castles and villages, and the detail is amazing. And not a single CGI effect - everything was done with practical effects.

A few years ago they made a Netflix series called The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance, which is also really good. It uses modern CGI effects but keeps the same spirit and style of the original movie.

Watching this makes me want to rewatch the original movie again. It's a classic.

## Sparked Discoveries

Here’s a handful of links I found intriguing recently:

### [Castle for Sale?](https://www.fineandcountry.co.uk/tunbridge-wells-estate-agents/property-sale/4-bedroom-detached-house-for-sale-in-tn11-0eg-tonbridge-hadlow-high-street-hadlow-castle/4220849)

It's not often that I will link to a house for sale and claim it's inspiring, but this one is different. Hadlow Castle in Kent, England, is a unique property with a rich history and stunning architecture. The castle features the world's tallest Victorian Gothic Tower and has been lovingly updated to include modern amenities while preserving its historical charm. It looks amazing. I’d love the £2.8 million to buy it!

### [Doctype: Type-in programming magazine](https://vole.wtf/doctype/)

Back in the 80s and 90s there were quite a few programming magazines that featured type-in code to make games and programs. Most of the time you would spend hours typing the code into your computer, and then when you run it there would be an error. At least that was my experience! Doctype is a modern take on this concept and features code you can type-in to create small web programs. It's a fun idea and I'm looking forward to getting my copy!

### [LEGO MRI Scanner: Helping Children Cope with Anxiety](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/13/lego-mri-scanner-anxiety-sedation-children.html)

This is a really cool idea. MRI scanners are scary for anybody, especially children who don't understand what is happening. To help with this some hospitals in the US have been giving out Lego models of MRI scanners to children before their scans. The models are designed to look like the real thing. They have found that children who build the models are less anxious and less likely to need sedation during their scans. It's a great example of how a simple idea can make a big difference.
