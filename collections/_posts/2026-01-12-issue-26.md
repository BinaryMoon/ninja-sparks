Hi there - welcome to 2026!

After a bit of a break over the holidays I am pleased to be back writing this newsletter.

I had a lovely holiday break with my family. We had 2 christmas celebrations with different groups of people so I am well and truly stuffed full of indulgent foods.

I was planning to take a bit of a break from "working" but I really enjoy what I do so I spent quite a lot of time working on [BeepMini](https://beepmini.com) over the break. I am now working on AI enemies. It was overwhelming at first but I think I am getting somewhere now. I have a basic enemy that can patrol, or move around ranomly. It also runs away if it catches on fire (fire is also a thing now). Next up is making enemies chase the player, and then attack.

I have also been planning other things I want to do this year. I have an idea for my next website, I want to make a 3 or 4 new games with BeepMini, and I want to make some improvements to [Brush Ninja](https://brush.ninja/). So lots of fun things for me to work on!

## Resolutions

I don't make traditional new years resolutions but I do like to set goals for the year. One of the things I would like to do this year is to get better at artistic things. I have always been interested in art, and studied it at school, but I don't feel like I have improved much since then. So this year I want to spend time trying to get better at drawing/ painting, and 3D art.

### Drawing and Painting

{% include embed-youtube.html video="9ceNUTFVcsM" %}

I tend to draw unrealistic things. Cartoons and fantasy stuff is most fun for me. I have a few sketch books on the go at all times and I would like to get better at drawing people, and environments/ landscapes. Especially from imagination.

I have a bunch of how to draw books from the [Etherington Brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Etherington_Brothers), 2 prolific comic artists from the UK. They publish loads of [tutorial images on social media](https://www.instagram.com/etheringtonbrothers/), and then compile them into books, selling a new book each year (via kickstarter). I plan to work through some of these books and practice the techniques they teach.

I also want to do more life drawing. But I don't have much free time so I am going to use one of the many websites that provide life drawing references. _Keep in mind, if you're clicking through to these sites that they do feature non-sexual nudity_. I have used [Line of Action](https://line-of-action.com/), [Sketch Daily](https://www.sketchdaily.net/en), and [Quick Poses](https://quickposes.com/), and they all have something different to offer. Worth checking out for timed drawing practice.

I also like watching videos of artists drawing and painting on YouTube. Some of my favourites are:

* [Stephen Travers Art](https://www.youtube.com/@stephentraversart/shorts) - Wonderful pen and ink drawings with lots of tips and techniques.
* [James Gurney](https://www.youtube.com/user/gurneyjourney) - James is a brilliant traditional artist, and author of the _Dinotopia_ books. He has a lot of great videos about painting techniques and materials.
* [Proko](https://www.youtube.com/user/ProkoTV) - Proko has a lot of great videos about figure drawing and anatomy. His artistic style is very oriented towards manga comic books but the techniques are applicable to all styles.
* [Vanidas Mangathil](https://www.youtube.com/@VanidasMangathilArt/videos) - Vanidas is a self taught watercolour artist with a lovely loose style. His videos are like ASMR - very relaxing to watch. But also I find them inspirational for the amount of detail he can get from such few brush strokes.

### 3D Art

{% include embed-youtube.html video="BzTN2yTgTj0" %}

I studied 3D art with 3D Studio Max at university because I wanted to work in video games as an artist. But that never happened. During Covid I started learning [Blender]({% link _library/app/2025-03-20-blender.md %}) which I really enjoyed using but I never had an end goal in mind. This year however I want to make some simple 3D games so it might be time to get back into Blender and learn some more advanced techniques.

For getting started I am going to work through Grant Abbits tutorials on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/GrantAbbitt). He has a lot of great beginner and intermediate tutorials that cover a wide range of topics. Sice it's been a while I will start with his [Blender 5 beginers guide](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn3ukorJv4vv9_e-htADGsPX9TMaQpHV8) - hopefully I can speedrun it since I already know the basics. Then I will look at his [animation tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn3ukorJv4vuJVY3cjDJyt9bK6D-xACO3) since I want to make some simple animated characters for my games.

Other people/ tutorials that look good include:

* Lacruzo - [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@lacruzo/videos) only a few tutorials but they have a lovely cartoony style that I am a fan of. The tutorials cover grease pencil (2D in 3D) and low poly modelling, all in a cel-shaded style.
* Polygon Runway - [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/PolygonRunway) and [website](https://polygonrunway.com/) - This is where I started during Covid. The paid tutorials are great and start very slowly taking you through the basics (start with the Become a 3D illustrator course). The later paid tutorials get going a lot quicker and assume a higher level of knowledge.
* Crashsune Academy - [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcaQc6eQjXCzYski4EEr-iRfdkXkX-P3g) - This is a playlist of tutorials focused on making a low polygon anime cartoon character. Looks like a good fit for what I want to do.

## Sparked Discoveries

Here’s a handful of links I found intriguing recently:

### [Affinity Font Bundle](https://www.affinity.studio/blog/fcr)

{% include embed-image.html image="/images/updates/2026/FontsmithHeader.webp" %}

A couple of issues ago I talked about Affinity Studio, the latest offering from Canva (who aquired Serif, the makers of the Affinity apps). As a thank you for existing customers (of which I am one) they have just released a premium font bundle for free. You have to link your Affinity account and then you can claim the fonts.

### [Size of Life](https://neal.fun/size-of-life/)

{% include embed-image.html image="/images/updates/2026/neal-fun-size-of-life.jpeg" %}

A new [Neal.fun](https://neal.fun/) interactive webpage that shows the size of different life forms on Earth. From the smallest bacteria to the largest whales, and everything in between. You scroll and keep on scrolling to see key life forms and how they compare to each other. It's a fun way to get a sense of scale and appreciate the diversity of life on our planet.

### [Enclose Horse](https://enclose.horse/)

{% include embed-image.html image="/images/updates/2026/enclose-horse.png" %}

A simple web game for you about locking a horse in a paddock. You have to add fences to the field to keep the horse contained. The larger the paddock the more points you get, but there's limited fence pieces and some obstacles (like portals?) that make it more challenging. There's a new puzzle each day.

## Currently listening to

Thought I would try something new this issue - sharing what I am currently listening to whilst writing the newsletter. I have always had a complex about my musical taste - I like a lot of different things and don't normally share what I listen to for fear of judgement. I'm trying to be more carefree so here goes...

We will start the year with a song with some swears in it (sorry). The [Sofa by Wolf Alice](https://link.deezer.com/s/329ji8xA5iKpHXq33t1Se). It's a really beautiful song about getting older and learning to enjoy the quieter moments in life. The radio edit has no swear words and is better for it, unfortunately I can't find that on the streaming services.

As a family we mostly listen to [Radio X](https://www.radiox.co.uk/) in the car - and sometimes in the house - and this was their record of the year for 2025 (voted for by the public). Personally I voted for Florence and the Machines ['Everybody Scream'](https://link.deezer.com/s/329jpucukSIdg5AiIbhHB) but it was a close call and I nearly voted for The Sofa.
