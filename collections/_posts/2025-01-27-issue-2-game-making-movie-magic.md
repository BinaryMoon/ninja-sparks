title: Game Making and Movie Magic

Welcome to the second issue of **Ninja Sparks**, your bi-weekly dose of creative inspiration, tools, and ideas!

After a few days of working through my taxesâ€”never fun or inspiringâ€”I'm thrilled to have them finished for the year. To celebrate, I treated myself to some PokÃ©mon singles. There's something about the artwork on PokÃ©mon cards that feels like collecting tiny art works. One day, I'd love to create my own Trading Card Game, but that's a distant dream at the moment.

For now, I'm diving back into my JavaScript game library. I started it last October and can't wait to get it online. I'm a big believer in releasing early and often, so I'm hoping to share a preview soon. That's when things get really interesting for meâ€”collecting feedback from real people and building something even better.

## Pocket Platformer

Ever wanted to create your own retro-style platformer game? [Pocket Platformer][pocket-platformer-link] makes it easier than ever! I canâ€™t quite remember how I stumbled across it, but my son was with me, and heâ€™s since spent hours making his own little games.

{% include embed-image.html image="/images/updates/pocket-platformer-screenshot.png" caption="A screenshot of Pocket Platformer with a simple game level I created" %}

The app is incredibly easy to use for creating simple, tiny platformersâ€”and surprisingly powerful. Just experimenting, I discovered lots of possibilities. But after reading [the devlogs](https://the-l0bster.itch.io/pocket-platformer/devlog), I realized thereâ€™s so much more you can do. If you want to dig deeper, you can create some really complex games.

Once you're done, you can download your game as a single HTML file to upload to your website, play offline, or share with friends. Itâ€™s a clever setupâ€”packaging everything into one file makes sharing and hosting games so much simpler than traditional methods that use multiple files.

If youâ€™d rather just play games, check out this collection of Pocket Platformer creations on [itch.io](https://itch.io/c/1932056/games-made-with-pocket-platformer).

With its intuitive drag-and-drop interface and focus on simplicity, this browser-based app is perfect for creators of all ages and skill levels. Design levels, add characters, and share your creationsâ€”let your imagination run wild!

## How Massive Film Sets are Designed and Built

Take a behind-the-scenes look at the fascinating world of set design on the Apple TV show *Silo* with Adam Savage.

*Note: These videos contain some spoilers for Season 2 of Silo. If youâ€™re planning to watch it, you might want to save them for later.*

I really miss the detailed behind-the-scenes features we used to get on DVDs. While Disney+ still offers some, they often feel more like promotional material than true insights into the creative process.

This is where YouTube really shines. As a Brit, Iâ€™ve always been aware of Adam Savage and *MythBusters*, though I never had the opportunity to watch it. But since he transitioned to YouTube, Iâ€™ve come across so many fun, movie-related videos.

Adam has made multiple videos about *Silo*, including ones on stunts, VFX, and more. If youâ€™re a fan of filmmaking, theyâ€™re well worth exploring!

## Sparked Discoveries

### 1. [Nintendo Switch 2 Announced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxLUf2kRQRE)
Back in the 80's and 90's there were a lot of arguments at school about whether you were a Nintendo or Sega fan. These things were based entirely upon what console your parents bought you. But I got my start with Nintendo - and I've owned all the major consoles since the NES. So even though the Switch 2 does not look as revolutionary as some of their consoles, I'm still looking forward to it. I love that Nintendo focus on fun for everyone over chasing specifications.

### 2. [Interview with Takaya Inamura, Nintendo Game Artist](https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/jan/20/inside-story-nintendo-takaya-inamura)
This is a fantastic interview with Takaya Inamura, a veteran game artist who spent over 30 years at Nintendo. He shares insights about his work on iconic titles like *Zelda* and *Star Fox*, as well as his journey into the industry.   I love hearing stories like thisâ€”itâ€™s inspiring to see someone stay passionate about their craft for so long. Itâ€™s also a great reminder of the incredible talent and dedication that fuel the games we love.

### 3. [Promptbrush](https://www.delcan.co/promptbrush)
This is such a fun concept, and it even inspired another project Iâ€™m working on. Itâ€™s a website where you can request a picture, and an artist creates a unique, hand-made piece of art for you. The idea is meant to be an antidote to AI-generated artâ€”a process that often uses real artists' work without permission to cobble together something new. Here, the artwork is created by a real person, making it truly one of a kind. I love this am working on something similar for [Brush Ninja](https://brush.ninja). The only thing holding me back is the fear of being overwhelmedâ€”animations take much longer to make than a single image, so I might end up making them endlessly!

### 4. [An Amazing House in Boca Raton](https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/1201-Marble-Way-Boca-Raton-FL-33432/87660584_zpid/)
Someone shared this unique house in Boca Raton on [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/binarymoon.bsky.social) recently, and it left me in awe. Letâ€™s set aside the eye-watering price and the sheer number of bedrooms for a momentâ€”what really stands out is the intense interior design. There are actually parts I love. Every wall doubles as a cupboard, making it super practical, and the art workshop (complete with sculpting tools, a kiln, and a printing press) is absolutely my dream space. Iâ€™m also a fan of the kids' (or perhaps guest) room with the bunk bedsâ€”check out photo #139! That said, the rest of the design feels a bit overwhelming for me. Still, I canâ€™t help but admire the creativity. Itâ€™s clear the previous owners loved this spaceâ€”they wouldnâ€™t have gone all-in on such bold design choices otherwise.
