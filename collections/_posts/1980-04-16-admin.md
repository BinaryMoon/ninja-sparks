## [Play Pride](https://fujio-pand-park.tumblr.com/)

This is an amusing selection of photos from Japan showing a wide array of playground equipment. In the UK playgrounds tend to be fairly standardised. Lots of wooden frames, metal poles, and slides. These Japanese playgrounds are incredibly imaginitive, with play equipment designed to look like all sorts of things - often animals. Some are based on real animals, and others are fantastical creations. They add a lot of personality and fun to the playgrounds. Of course it's not just animals, there's robots, buildings, and abstract shapes too. It's a great reminder that playgrounds can be more than just functional spaces - they can be places that spark imagination and joy - ideal for their intended audience!
