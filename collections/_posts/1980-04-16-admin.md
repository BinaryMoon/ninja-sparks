### [Winamp Skin Museum](https://www.winampskins.com/)

{% include embed-browsershots-thumb.html url="https://www.winampskins.com/" %}

This is a fun site for the older readers who remember Winamp. It showcases the skins that were made for the popular media player. This was before the days of endless streaming when I used to hoard MP3s and play them in the Winamp player. It feels very quaint now but it was a big part of the internet in the early 2000s. Reading the about page on the site I found out it's actually a custom front end for the Internet Archives [Winamp collection](https://archive.org/details/winampskins).



### [Get Up Close to Frank Lloyd Wright's Unrealized Buildings with David Romero's Digital Models](https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2025/06/david-romero-frank-lloyd-wright/)

These are awesome. David Romero has created digital models of Frank Lloyd Wright's unrealised buildings. In a project titled 'Hooked on the Past' David uses 3D modelling to recreate imagined designs and render them as if they were really built. The results are stunning and provide a unique perspective on Wright's visionary architecture.
