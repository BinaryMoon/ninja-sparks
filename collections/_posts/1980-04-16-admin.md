### [Get Up Close to Frank Lloyd Wright's Unrealized Buildings with David Romero's Digital Models](https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2025/06/david-romero-frank-lloyd-wright/)

These are awesome. David Romero has created digital models of Frank Lloyd Wright's unrealised buildings. In a project titled 'Hooked on the Past' David uses 3D modelling to recreate imagined designs and render them as if they were really built. The results are stunning and provide a unique perspective on Wright's visionary architecture.
