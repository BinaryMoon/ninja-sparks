## How Muppets Break Free from Their Puppeteers

{% include embed-youtube.html video="t86ZjhGxwAY" %}

A fun, short, video showcasing some of the secrets behind the Muppets and how they are pupeteered. This is a great video for anyone who enjoys the Muppets and seeing how films come together.

You might have noticed I enjoy this sort of thing (and also how magic tricks are done). So seeing how the Muppets are animated, when there's no puppeteer visible, seemingly cycling/ rowing a boat, is fascinating. I had seen behind the scenes footage of Kermit playing the banjo on a log in the swamp before, but the rest is new to me. Maybe it is to you as well.


## [Teenage Engineering Choir](https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2025/07/teenage-engineering-choir/)

{% include embed-youtube.html video="3Pcp0au-IBY" %}

I only became aware of Teenage Engineering a few years ago when they designed the [Playdate](https://play.date/) console, and since then I've seen the [Nothing phone](https://nothing.tech/) as well. Their main projects are music based and they often incorporate unique design elements and user interfaces that set them apart from other tech companies. I really like their design aesthetic, often called Cassette Futurism, which is a blend of retro and modern design elements. However their most recent project is a bit different, it's still music based but it's a collection of wooden characters that can connect together to form a choir. I enjoy the design of these characters but I don't think I can afford them. I shall enjoy searching for them on Youtube instead. There's more information about the choir on [Colossal](https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2025/07/teenage-engineering-choir/).







### [Frame of Reference](https://aresluna.org/frame-of-preference/)

This is a really clever article about the history of the Mac Operating system. I know this doesn't sound that clever, but actually, if you visit on a desktop computer/ laptop, then the screenshots of the old Mac OS versions are actually interactive working versions of the operating system. You can click around and use them, even going so far as to run apps and play games.







### [Punpages](https://punpages.com/)

{% include embed-browsershots-thumb.html url="https://punpages.com/" %}

This is a fun site that shows photos of businesses with names that are puns. It's designed like the Yellow Pages phone book but all the businesses have funny names. It's a primarily UK based website but there are puns available from all over the world, along with a form for submitting new ones. Keep in mind that even though these are public businesses some of the names are a bit rude, so be careful if you are looking at this with kids around!






### [GifCities](https://gifcities.org/)

{% include embed-browsershots-thumb.html url="https://gifcities.org/" %}

Gifcities is the internet archive's collection of animated GIFs from the early days of the web. Form me it's a nostalgic trip down memory lane, showcasing the creativity and humor of the early internet. You can search for specific GIFs or just browse through the collection. The site has recently been updated with improved search - there's  write up about it on the [Internet Archive blog](https://blog.archive.org/2025/06/09/keep-on-gifin-a-new-version-of-gifcities-internet-archives-geocities-animated-gif-search-engine/).




### [Winamp Skin Museum](https://www.winampskins.com/)

{% include embed-browsershots-thumb.html url="https://www.winampskins.com/" %}

This is a fun site for the older readers who remember Winamp. It showcases the skins that were made for the popular media player. This was before the days of endless streaming when I used to hoard MP3s and play them in the Winamp player. It feels very quaint now but it was a big part of the internet in the early 2000s. Reading the about page on the site I found out it's actually a custom front end for the Internet Archives [Winamp collection](https://archive.org/details/winampskins).




### [Fictional Brands Archive](https://fictionalbrandsarchive.com/)

{% include embed-browsershots-thumb.html url="https://fictionalbrandsarchive.com/" %}

This website brings together a vast array of fictional brands and their logos from movies, TV shows, Cartoons and video games. It's interesting scrolling through them all and seeing how many I can recognise.



### [Island Doodle 2](https://mattstark.itch.io/islandoodle-ii)

This is a fun little game where you can create your own island by adding different elements to a grid. Start off with the land, then add trees, buildings (castles), docks and other features to make your own unique island. This is a part of a collection of similar games by the same developer, Matt Stark. I also enjoy [Tramsterdam](https://mattstark.itch.io/tramstertram) which is a similar toy but you can create your own tram network in a miniature Amsterdam, complete with working trams. These art toys are browser based versions of other similar games like [Townscaper](https://oskarstalberg.com/Townscaper) and [Tiny Glade](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2198150/Tiny_Glade/). All of these apps use a programming concept called Wave Function Collapse to create art that seamlessly fits together. There's a great article, that makes quite a complex thing easy to understand, on Robert Heaton's blog about [Wave Function Collapse](https://robertheaton.com/2020/01/27/wave-function-collapse/) if you want to learn more about it.








### [Get Up Close to Frank Lloyd Wright's Unrealized Buildings with David Romero's Digital Models](https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2025/06/david-romero-frank-lloyd-wright/)

These are awesome. David Romero has created digital models of Frank Lloyd Wright's unrealised buildings. In a project titled 'Hooked on the Past' David uses 3D modelling to recreate imagined designs and render them as if they were really built. The results are stunning and provide a unique perspective on Wright's visionary architecture.
