I sometimes wonder if I'm just an auld fella shaking my fist at clouds when I back off from modern tech, but the truth is, most big tech products are no longer built to be useful, they're built to rinse you for a minimum standard service. And even children can see this.

https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/secureknot.htm?ref=aftermath.site
from: https://aftermath.site/ians-shoelace-site-is-still-the-best-destination-for-tying-your-shoes/

Firstly - the secure knot is a great idea, and I'm surprised this is the first time I've seen it. I was in the Scouts as a kid, and know a lot of different knots, but the standard shoelace knot is what I was always taught. I will definitely be trying this as it looks really useful. However, I found out about this site because of this article on Aftermath. Aftermath is a site covering videogames and the internet and in the article they talk about not only how to tie shoelaces, but also why sites that hyperfocus on one thing, are slowly disappearing from the web. Sites that are passion projects, or quirky fun niches. Having used the internet since the mid 90s I have seen many of these sites, in the early days it's all there was. And I really like this sort of thing, it's what NinjaSparks is all about. However it's also sad to see them being lost. The problem is that most people don't really use the internet any more. People focus on a few social networks, and maybe a news site or two. Google is slowly killing their search engine, filling it with inaccurate ai, and adverts. People are turning to AI like ChatGPT for ansewrs, which is also often wrong, and doesn't actually send people to the original sources. This is one of the reasons my websites focus on interactive content. Apps and games can not easily be replaced by AI, and people still have to visit my site to use them. But I worry that the internet is becoming a bland, homogenised place and perhaps quirky niche sites like Ian's Shoelace site will become a thing of the past.
