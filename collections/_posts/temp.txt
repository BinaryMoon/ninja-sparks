##  Why people believe they can't draw - and how to prove they can

This TEDx talk, *Why people believe they can’t draw – and how to prove they can*, is a short and uplifting watch. Presenter Graham Shaw makes a strong case: drawing isn’t a rare talent, it’s a skill anyone can learn—with the right mindset and a few simple techniques.

If you’ve ever said “I can’t draw,” this talk is worth your time. It’s not about becoming a pro artist. It’s about unlocking the joy of making marks on a page and watching them turn into something recognisable.

I’ve always dabbled with drawing. People sometimes tell me I’m good at it, but I rarely feel that way—especially when I compare my work to what I see online. That feeling of *not being good enough*? It’s common. My son, for example, is great at copying characters from Looshkin, Dogman, and Pokémon, but still insists he “can’t draw.” He’s drawing all the time, but he doesn’t see it as real art.

This video made me reflect on that mindset. Over time, I’ve learned to stop worrying whether something looks “good.” I draw potatoes. Stick figures. Blobs. Doesn’t matter. The fun is in the doing, not the result.

And that’s exactly the point of this talk. Graham gets his audience sketching cartoon faces before they even realise what’s happening—and suddenly, they’re drawing. Smiling. Having fun.

If you’ve ever wanted to draw but felt you weren’t “good enough,” give it a go. Not every scribble needs to be a masterpiece. Sometimes it’s enough just to pick up the pen.
