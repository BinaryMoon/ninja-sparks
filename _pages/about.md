Ninja Sparks is a newsletter that ties together my love of creative things.

I've long looked for what my purpose is. What I excell at. And I think it's this. It's making things that inspire and delight. And I want to share the things that I find that inspire and delight me.

I had a newsletter on [Brush Ninja](https://brush.ninja) but it was never quite right. I wanted it to be more engaging and interesting. It took me 3 years to figure it out but I eventually realised that making the type of newsletter I wanted to read was the way to go.

Ninja Sparks is that newsletter. It's a mix of tools, tips, and fun for creative play. It's a mix of things that I find interesting and inspiring and that I hope you will too.
