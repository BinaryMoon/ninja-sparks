Ninja Sparks is a one-person project, and I'm always on the lookout for fresh ideas to feature on the site. If you have a suggestion for a new Spark or something you'd like to submit, I'd love to hear from you! Just fill out the form below.

I personally review every submission and look for ideas that spark inspiration or excitement. While not everything will make the cut, I'll be sure to credit and thank you in the post if your suggestion is featured.
